# bear.ski
This is my website! I made it using Angular, Bootstrap, SASS, Node.js and TypeScript. It's run on my own server with process management handled by PM2.

## Deploy
If you want to run this on your own system it's as easy as running the following.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skistaddy/bear.ski.git
cd bear.ski
npm install
ng build
node index
```
