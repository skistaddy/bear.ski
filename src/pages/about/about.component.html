hey, my name is baran skistad. i've been teaching myself to code since 
i was thirteen years old and now i'm twenty-one! i specialize in
everything javascript, i love it all. i'd consider myself fluent in 
javascript while being intermediate in python, c, and SQL.

outside of coding i love to play and make music with my guitar and
play video games with my girl friend in my spare time.
